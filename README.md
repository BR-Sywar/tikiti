During my internship at Dormalcorp,
I engineered a Ticketing and Reservation Platform designed to streamline event management processes.
The platform was built with a focus on scalability, utilizing database optimization and a modular architecture to handle increasing traffic and data loads.
I developed a mobile app allowing users to browse, reserve, and purchase tickets with ease, providing a smooth and intuitive experience. 
Additionally, I created a web-based admin platform where event organizers could manage reservations, track sales, and configure event settings,
further improving operational efficiency.
